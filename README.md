this is a **per-hour** weather predictor using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Deep Learning Technique.
It is a fully deployed web app that first is trained on the NASA POWER dataset of past15 years of climate conditions of specific locations like maharashtra/haryana/etc.
using LSTM, I have madeper hour predictions for **temperature, pressure and humidity** for this entire year 2024 in advance using previous year data.
The result is stored in database and a web app can be used to access any day of the Year to view the predictions in the browser itself!
